### What is this?

This adds a new entry on my GSIs in Treble Settings called "My Device".
The goal is to give users a way to contact the community related to their devices, and also have a main point of contact to debug issues.

Also, this contains presets, so that if your device works better with some Treble Settings enabled, users will get it out of the box as soon as they get WiFi.

### Who can be a maintainer?

Really, anyone. The requirements I have for someone to become a maintainer is:
1. Have that device (not a "close to" device)
2. Know how to take logs
3. Be available to users asking questions, and reproduce issues
4. Forward me the actual issues to [my bug tracker](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/issues)

Of course, if on top of that, you manage to fix issues by yourself, and send those fixes to me, it's better :-)

### Replacing maintainer

You want to replace me(phhusson) as maintainer of any device? Feel free! I have too many devices already!
